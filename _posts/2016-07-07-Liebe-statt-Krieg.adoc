==== Légion étrangère
Last weekend I considered this as an option. Maybe it remains one, but I am not so sure anymore. Surely, with them I could have travelled up the long river and mybay find something. But then running away isn't really me. Fighting is though. Admittedly, there is a bit of Don Quixote in me, which may ultimately lead to a even bigger mess. But then I think it is important to fight for a better world. Say your opinion, stand in for your believes. Oh, and:
__make love, not war__. The haka yesterday certainly helped too.

Filled with new desire to fight

Song For The Broken Hearted
it hit me like a ton of bricks to my chest
it's something that i never would of guessed
that you would be walking out that door
all the times i shared with you it was the best
i never would of thought you would of left
don't wanna stick around with me anymore
now i, i wish you would of told me
why, instead of just up and leaving before you said good-bye
if you ever love someone..

if you ever really love somebody
what do you do when you lose somebody
this one is for the broken hearted
for the ones that's feeling all alone
if you ever really love somebody
know how it feels when you lose somebody
this one is for the broken hearted
for the ones that's feeling all alone

everyday it seems like rain is falling down
but nobody ever seems to be around
these pictures are bitter sweet memories
holding my head from pain that doesn't go away
and every morning i see your face baby
cos my mind forgets that you're not here
now i, i wish you would of told me
why, instead of just up and leaving before you said good-bye
if you ever..

if you ever really love somebody (if you ever)
what do you do when you lose somebody
this one is for the broken hearted (broken hearted )
for the ones that's feeling all alone (all alone)
if you ever really love somebody
know how it feels when you lose somebody
this one is for the broken hearted
for the ones that's feeling all alone

nobody wants to live alone (no they don't wanna live)
and if you've been touched by the words in this song
then you know if you ever..

if you ever really love somebody
what do you do when you lose somebody (oh)
this one is for the broken hearted (broken hearted)
for the ones that's feeling all alone (all alone)
if you ever really love somebody
know how it feels when you lose somebody
this one is for the broken hearted
for the ones that's feeling all alone

if you ever really love somebody
what do you do when you lose somebody (if you ever loved)
this one is for the broken hearted
for the ones that's feeling all alone (if you ever loved)
if you ever really love somebody
know how it feels when you lose somebody
this one is for the broken hearted
for the ones that's feeling all alone

oooh oooh oooh
no oooh oooh oooh
no oooh oooh oooh
ooooh
this is for the broken hearted
